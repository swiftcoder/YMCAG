This class does absolutely nothing.  It's a text file for taking notes during production.

So it's down to game design thinking.  Need to figure out resources and their effects.  Population gives you stable stalls.  Madness gives you parts access.

Sacrifices give you... farms that generate population?  Madness boosts?  Population boosts?  Negatives?  3 are the baseline slots, boosted by having more population.
I think that the initial goat cap should be 3, and the number you start with should be 2.  That way the player will easily get both warning messages and should 
understand the two fundamental things they can do.

We may need to scale back.  Way back for our alpha.  The goal is to reach a certain amount of madness before all your people die.  The gods' demands affect (mostly kill)
population, as do your creatures.  The idea is to balance keeping creatures alive for insanity while fulfilling enough demands so that your population doesn't die out.

I think... I think that the gods' demands need to be done in icons.  Creature parts (with faded rest of the goat) and reward/punishment.

So really what I need is a way to compare part by number and type (two ints) rather than by a string.
